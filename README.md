# Simplified Explanation of the Code

This code enables your iOS app to communicate with an internet-based API to retrieve user information.

## 1. Importing Moya
First, import Moya, a networking library that simplifies sending and receiving HTTP requests.

## 2. Defining the API
Define an API enum to specify the endpoints your app can access:
- An endpoint for retrieving a list of users.
- Another for fetching details about a specific user.

## 3. Setting the Base URL
The base URL for all requests is set to "jsonplaceholder.typicode.com." This is the main endpoint from which data is fetched.

## 4. Specifying Paths
Each endpoint is associated with a path:
- For a list of users, the path is "todos/"
- For user details, the path is "todos/" followed by the user's ID.

## 5. Making Requests
All requests are GET requests, specifying that the response should be in JSON format.

## 6. Creating the Network Manager
A NetworkManager class is created to manage API requests. It uses Moya's networking functionality to perform these requests.

## 7. NetworkManager's Jobs
The NetworkManager handles two main tasks:
1. *Fetch User List*: A function that retrieves a list of users from the server.
2. *Fetch User Details*: A function that takes a user ID and fetches detailed information for that user.

## 8. Sending Requests
The NetworkManager's request function is responsible for making HTTP requests and processing the responses.

When a response is received, it checks for errors. If successful, it returns the requested data. Otherwise, it handles errors such as network unavailability.

## Conclusion
This code setup simplifies interaction with the user API, making it easy to request and receive user data in a structured format.
